# **state**
Here, you can create all files related to state management and business logic in general. Packages like [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) and [riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) can help with that.

A `bloc` for example can interact with a repository to fetch data.

Also, a `providers` section. Here, we can provide services like our repositories, a custom navigation service, a firebase auth or firestore service, etc.
