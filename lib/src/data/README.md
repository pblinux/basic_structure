# **data**
All files and clases related to data, like models, data sources and repositories.

- For models, can use a couple of packages like [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) and [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) that extends functionallity over simple Dart data clases.

- Data sources can be any kind of source, local or remote like firebase, an REST API, GraphQL, SharedPreferences or a local DB like [sqlite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) or [hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive).
